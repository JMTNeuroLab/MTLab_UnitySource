# ML_Clean
Unity Project for MonkeyLogic interface via LSL. 

Using Unity version 2019.1.8f1. 

You should just be able to clone the repo and open the directory as a project. 

At the moment you can only run the task in the editor (not in fullscreen). It is missing some functionality and the MonkeyLogic ITIs are VERY long. But it works.
